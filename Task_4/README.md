# Task 4 - Layer-wise Learning Rate Implementation

## Overview
This directory is for Task 4 of the project, showcasing a model architecture configured with layer-wise learning rates. The Python script, `task_4_model.py`, demonstrates setting different learning rates for various layers of the network.

## Contents
- `task_4_model.py`: This script contains an untrained model that shows how to apply different learning rates to different layers.
- `Task_4.pdf`: A comprehensive document that explains the rationale for using layer-wise learning rates, detailing how this approach can optimize training across diverse network layers.

## How to Use
- Examine `task_4_model.py` to understand how layer-wise learning rates are implemented.
- Refer `Task_4.pdf` for an explanation of specific decisions made during model configuration.
