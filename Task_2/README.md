# Task 2 - Multi-Task Learning Model

## Overview
This directory contains the implementation for Task 2 of the project. The Python script, `task_2_model.py`, outlines a multi-task learning framework using a transformer model to handle different NLP tasks simultaneously.

## Contents
- `task_2_model.py`: The script includes an untrained multi-task learning model which demonstrates how to configure a transformer model to handle multiple tasks such as sentence classification and sentiment analysis.
- `Task_2.pdf`: A detailed document explaining the rationale behind the model's architecture, the decisions made during the implementation.

## How to Use
- Review the `task_2_model.py` to see the setup of the multi-task learning model.
- For a detailed understanding of the implementation choices and theoretical background, refer to the `Task_2.pdf`.
